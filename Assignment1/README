* Execution of program
----------------------
This program can be run using the makefile attached.

command line input: 
make
./main

* Selection options
-------------------
Program #1) Prints out every single permutation of the string provided in "main.c",
			in this instance, "CARBON"

command line input:
>Which question would you like to select?
>1. Carbon?
>2. Ackermann?
>3. Newton's method
>4. Exit.
>
>Please select an option:
1
>
>
>CARBON
>CARBNO
>CAROBN
>...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program #2) This program will ask you to input two numbers, 'm' and 'n'.
			These will be parameters accepted by "ackermann.c" which recursively
			calls itself and returns a value that corresponds to the following 
			definitions:
			A(0, n) = n + 1					for n >= 0
			A(m, 0) = A(m - 1, 1)			for m > 0
			A(m, n) = A(m - 1, A(m, n -1))	for m, n > 0
			The maximum accepted input by this function is A(3,14). The program
			will restart if a value greater than A(3,14) is inputted. A message is
			shown to the user.

command line input:
>Which question would you like to select?
>1. Carbon?
>2. Ackermann?
>3. Newton's method
>4. Exit.
>
>Please select an option:
2
>
>
>Enter a value for m:
3
>Enter a value for n:
4
>A(3,4) = 125.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program #3) This program will calculate the square root of x by Newton's method.
			Initial approximations of 'a' are calculated as seen in the lab handout.

command line input:
>Which question would you like to select?
>1. Carbon?
>2. Ackermann?
>3. Newton's method>
>4. Exit.
>
>Please select an option:
3
>
>
>Which Newton program would you like to execute?
>1. Recursive.
>2. Non-recursive.
1
>Enter a value for x:
144
>Enter a value for e:
0.000001
>Approximate square root is: 12.000000.
